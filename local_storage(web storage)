<!--Before HTML5, application data had to be stored in cookies, included in every server request. Web storage is more secure,
and large amounts of data can be stored locally, without affecting website performance.
Unlike cookies, the storage limit is far larger (at least 5MB) and information is never transferred to the server.

HTML web storage provides two objects for storing data on the client:

    window.localStorage - stores data with no expiration date
    window.sessionStorage - stores data for one session (data is lost when the browser tab is closed)

-->
