A web worker is a JavaScript running in the background, without affecting the performance of the page.

What is a Web Worker?
When executing scripts in an HTML page, the page becomes unresponsive until the script is finished.

A web worker is a JavaScript that runs in the background, independently of other scripts, without affecting the performance of the page.
You can continue to do whatever you want: clicking, selecting things, etc., while the web worker runs in the background.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<p>Count numbers: <output id="result"></output></p>
<button onclick="startWorker()">Start Worker</button> 
<button onclick="stopWorker()">Stop Worker</button>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Internet Explorer 9 and earlier versions do not support Web Workers.</p>

<script>
var w;

function startWorker() {
  if(typeof(Worker) !== "undefined") {
    if(typeof(w) == "undefined") {
      w = new Worker("demo_workers.js");
    }
    w.onmessage = function(event) {
      document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = event.data;
    };
  } else {
    document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = "Sorry, your browser does not support Web Workers...";
  }
}

function stopWorker() { 
  w.terminate();
  w = undefined;
}
</script>

</body>
</html>

Server-Sent Events - One Way Messaging

A server-sent event is when a web page automatically gets updates from a server.

This was also possible before, but the web page would have to ask if any updates were available. 
With server-sent events, the updates come automatically.

Examples: Facebook/Twitter updates, stock price updates, news feeds, sport results, etc.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>Getting server updates</h1>
<div id="result"></div>

<script>
if(typeof(EventSource) !== "undefined") {
  var source = new EventSource("demo_sse.php");
  source.onmessage = function(event) {
    document.getElementById("result").innerHTML += event.data + "<br>";
  };
} else {
  document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = "Sorry, your browser does not support server-sent events...";
}
</script>

</body>
</html>

demo_sse.php:
 <?php
header('Content-Type: text/event-stream');
header('Cache-Control: no-cache');

$time = date('r');
echo "data: The server time is: {$time}\n\n";
flush();
?>
