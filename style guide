In HTML5, you don't have to close all elements (for example the <p> element).

We recommend closing all HTML elements.

HTML5 allows mixing uppercase and lowercase letters in element names.

HTML5 allows attribute values without quotes.

We recommend quoting attribute values.

In HTML5, the <html> tag and the <body> tag can be omitted.

The <html> element is the document root. It is the recommended place for specifying the page language:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">

Declaring a language is important for accessibility applications (screen readers) and search engines.

Omitting <html> or <body> can crash DOM and XML software.

Omitting <body> can produce errors in older browsers (IE9).

To ensure proper interpretation and correct search engine indexing, both the language and the character encoding should be defined as early as possible in a document.
